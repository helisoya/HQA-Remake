Intro_1 = The province of Vlatyr, peaceful constituant of the wider united provinces of Kosky.

Intro_15 = He then obtained an ancient artefact, capable of making its user much stronger.
Intro_16 = Using his newfound powers, he tried to kill his old nemesis.

Intro_22 = However, this newfound peace was soon to be disturbed again...
Intro_23 = The now empty fortress was full of gold and ancient artefacts.
Intro_24 = Greed pushed some individuals to seek to control the fortress.
Intro_25 = As they got ready to launch their respective expedition to the fortress, the province descended into uncertainty.
Intro_26 = Everyone knew that there would be one who would control the fortress. But who ? 
Intro_27 = And what would they do with their newfound money ? Live in luxury ? Try to take over the province ?
Intro_28 = Vlatyr needed a new hero. Someone who would come and defeat the troublemakers.
Intro_29 = And this is where you come in, hero !

Intro_32 = Two individuals expressed interest in taking over the fortress, out of greed.

Intro_39 = Ah ! But we'll have to think of a codename for you.
Intro_40 = You don't want your ennemies to recognize your real name. Plus, it's really cool !

Intro_49 = You should find him in Swamtyr, a small village next to the swamp.
Intro_50 = The second individual is Rickey, the CEO of RickeyLand, a local amusement park.
Intro_51 = Onced a revered CEO, it seems he went insane with greed.
Intro_52 = He wants to steal the fortress's gold, and make it his main residence.
Intro_53 = We can't let that happen. The gold doesn't belong to him.
Intro_54 = You'll probably find him at RickeyLand, altought the park is currently closed.
Intro_55 = Use any mean necessary to prevent them from attacking the fortress.
Intro_56 = I would recommand using non lethal force. But the choice is ultimatly yours.
Intro_57 = I can work with that.
Intro_58 = Great ! One last note. We are very short on time.
Intro_59 = They are getting ready as we speak, and may attack at any time.
Intro_60 = It is entierly possible that while you deal with one of them, the other could attack the fortress.
Intro_61 = If this happens, don't forget that your goal is to protect it.
Intro_62 = Got it. Anything else ?
Intro_63 = Ah, yes. First, I want you to go to Vlatyr.
Intro_64 = One of my acquaintance, Mr.Boyardee, has tools for you. You'll need them to fight our ennemies.
Intro_65 = So head over, and talk to him. That is all.
Intro_66 = Alright. I know everything I wanted.
Intro_67 = Oh, but do be mindful with him. He's... unique ?

Intro_73 = I was minding my own business, when I suddenly passed out.

Intro_75 = I couldn't care less. If anything, I would like to steal the gold for myself.

Intro_77 = Oh well, time to go to this 'Vlatyr' city.

Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_2 = Harold told me he had equipments for me. I hope he was right.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_3 = Because I sure as hell won't be eating here. The odor is fool...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_4 = Maybe that's why there aren't anyone here. How did the owner stay in business ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_5 = Oh, hello there !
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_6 = A strange man approaches me. He's wearing a chef outfit, is he the owner ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_7 = Coming to eat alone ? No problems !
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_8 = What will it be ? We have many types of pastas and salads. Today's special is the chocolate cinnamon pasta.  
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_9 = What the hell ? No, I'm not eating that.

Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_13 = I don't have much, a rope, a hook, stuff like that.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_14 = Enough to scale a wall at least.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_15 = Harold also told me to buy a gun, for safety. But I couldn't find one.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_16 = Apparently, a bunch of security guards from RickeyLand came in the morning. They bought everything.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_17 = This might be a problem. RickeyLand will be heavily guarded.

Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_19 = Yes, Uhm... actually... Could I ask a favor ?

Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_21 = I'm expecting a lot of clients in a moment, and I'm a little short-handed.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_22 = You seem dependable. Would you mind helping me serve them ?

Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_24 = Look, it's not that I don't want to, but I really need to hurry.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_25 = Harold sent me on an urgent mission, every minutes count.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_26 = If I don't hurry, we could all be in trouble.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_27 = But my clients are an urgent matter too ! I need your help.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_28 = ... You leave me no choice ! I didn't want to do this...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_29 = I'm taking the equipments hostage !
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_30 = You won't get them until you help me with the clients.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_31 = Is he serious ? I don't have time for this.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_32 = But... I don't have a choice, do I ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_33 = I could take them by force, but Harold would be furious.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_34 = Alright, I'll help you.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_35 = Splendid ! I'm happy we came to an arrangement.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_36 = And just in time ! It seems our clients are arriving.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_37 = Go into the kitchen, I'll tell you what to do.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_38 = Okay, okay.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_39 = I move towards the kitchen's door, at the back of the restaurant.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_40 = I don't have time for this, but here we go.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_41 = I enter the kitchen, and prepares myself for cooking.

Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_42 = I'm done with cooking. Finally...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_43 = I exit the kitchen. Boyardee has to give me the equipments now.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_44 = Ah, there you are. 
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_45 = It seems my clients are very impressed with your cooking. Good job.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_46 = Now, I won't get into troubles again at the conference.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_47 = Uh ? What conference ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_48 = Well... The clients are relatives of mine. They came to say "hi" essentially.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_49 = However, last time they came, I failed my cooking. The chocolate was too hot.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_50 = At the next familial conference, I was ridiculed for this...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_51 = So thanks to me, this failed cook will not be ridiculed next time...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_52 = I'm impressed he managed to stay open for so long. The ingredients he uses are... original.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_53 = Can I have the equipments now ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_55 = Oh, right ! Here.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_56 = He finally hands me the equipments I was searching for.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_57 = I trust you'll be able to succeed in your mission, whatever it is.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_58 = Yeah, yeah.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_59 = I already wasted too much time here. I have to hurry.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_60 = I start exiting the restaurant.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_61 = While doing so, I gaze upon the clients that ordered the pizzas.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_62 = They are a strange bunch... They are wearing robes, are they religious people ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_63 = Whatever, I don't have time for this.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_64 = I exit the restaurant. Thankfully, it's still nightime.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_65 = Time to-
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_66 = Hey, lad.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_67 = Some sort of hunter approaches me. What now ?            
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_68 = I'm searching for an Ash Grouse, did you see one ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_69 = A what ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_70 = A bird ! A little chicken ! A chicken that actually fly !
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_71 = I'm hunting it right now. But I can't find one...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_72 = I don't think you'll be able to find such a bird in a city.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_73 = Hmm.... You think so ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_74 = I asked Ol' Harold. "There are many Grouses in Vlatyr", he told me.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_75 = Maybe he misunderstood me.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_76 = Or maybe you misunderstood him. Vlatyr is also a region...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_77 = Shoot. I'll just go back home. Maybe I can spot one there.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_78 = If you find a Ash Grouse, or any type of bird, come see me.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_79 = I'll help you hunt it. I'm an expert sharpshooter.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_80 = The hunter walks away. What a strange encounter.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_81 = Time to attack our targets.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_82 = Rickey is hiding in RickeyLand, his amusement park.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_83 = The archer is currently staying in the small village of Swamtyr.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_84 = I have to be careful, I wasted too much time here. I may very well only be able to attack one of them.


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# -------------- Chez Marcel ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

ChezMarcel_Marcel_Default_1 = Hey, lad. Found any Ash Grouses ?

ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_1 = I'm just a local hunter. Nothing more.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_2 = I like to hunt grouses, and drink beers with my friends.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_3 = Do you know ol' Harold ? I drink with him sometimes.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_4 = Although he doesn't hunt. He says he doesn't like guns. I wonder why...

ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutRickey_1 = Rickey ? What's that, a bird ?
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutRickey_2 = I'm sorry, I only take interest in wild animals. I'm a hunter, you see.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutRickey_3 = Ol' Harold might be able to help you with this nerd stuff.

ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_1 = Oh, him ? I hate his guts...
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_2 = 'Came here a few months ago, I'm already fed up.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_3 = He can't stop bragging about that ogre he killed.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_4 = Let me tell you, hunting Ogre is cheating. Grouses are superior.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_5 = And I don't see him hunting grouses, no.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_6 = He spends his days in Swamtyr, bragging about his tale. What a loser...   

ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuestDone_1 = We showed this wanker what hunting really means.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuestDone_2 = Good ridance too... He was annoying.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuestDone_3 = Still. I can't believe he was going to kill all of Vlatyr's grouses.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuestDone_4 = I'm the only one authorised to do that !

ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_1 = Now to convince him to help me deal with the archer...
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_2 = Hey, lad. Have you found a Ash Grouse ?
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_3 = Oh, I know. He'll surely agree to help if I say that.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_4 = No, but I have bad news. It's about the archer.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_5 = Him ?! Don't tell me he killed yet another ogre...
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_6 = Please, I'll never hear the end of it.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_7 = No, no. I have troubling news however.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_8 = It seems he decided to kill all the grouses in the region.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_9 = What ?!
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_10 = If he succeeds, you can imagine how much he will brag.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_11 = Unacceptable ! It'll be the end of hunting in Vlatyr !
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_12 = I won't be able to hunt Ash Grouses anymore ! 
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_13 = I can't let this happen ! Where is this monster currently ?
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_14 = Perfect.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_15 = He's in the swamp, probably killing the wildlife as we speak.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_16 = I'll kill him ! He can't have my grouses !
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_17 = The hunter runs in the direction of the swamp. Perfect.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_18 = Now he'll help me deal with the archer.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_19 = The sneaky bastard won't be able to hide from me now. 
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_20 = Time to head to the swamp. We don't want him to get lost. 


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# ------------- Intersection ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------


Intersection_Intro_1 = I get to a crossroad. There are two paths in front of me.
Intersection_Intro_2 = The left path leads to some sort of amusement park. Maybe it's open ?
Intersection_Intro_3 = The right path leads to a dense forest.
Intersection_Intro_4 = I have to choose a path, but which one is the correct one ?


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# --------------- Rickeyland ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_1 = When I arrive to the park, I am greeted by a tank.
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_2 = What the hell ?!
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_3 = Ah Ah ! Time to go !
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_4 = The fortress and it's gold is mine !
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_5 = You there ! Get out of the way !
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_6 = The tank starts moving towards me.
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_7 = I move to the side, and watch it disapear in the distance.
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_8 = Damn it ! I was too late...
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_9 = He must be headed to the fortress. I must catch up to him.


RickeyLandEntrance_Door_No_1 = I don't need to enter the park.

Swamp_ArcherQuest1_1 = After walking for a bit, I manage to find a bridge.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_2 = Someone is currently on it, watching the opposite side of the river.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_3 = Is he the archer ? Time to find out.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_4 = I approach him. He seems to notice me, and turns around.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_5 = Why, hello there.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_6 = I'm the great archer. I'm sure you heard of my heroic tales.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_7 = Killer of the swamp's ogre, great hunter, and more !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_8 = But let's not talk about that other guy and the dragon. I'm the important one, okay ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_9 = But what brings you here ? Oh, I know !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_10 = You need protection ? Are you too afraid to walk in the streets ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_11 = I can help with that ! I can protect you from any danger.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_12 = Hum, no. I don't recquire your services.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_13 = Such a fierce stare... You are different.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_14 = You... are a rival. Are you not ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_15 = Why did you come here ? Do you want to challenge me, the great archer ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_16 = You are planing to attack the Braise Fortress. I can't let you do that.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_17 = Attack ? What a joke ! I'm only going to visit it for a bit.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_18 = You know, I'll walk in its empty corridors, filling my pockets with precious artefacts.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_19 = I was told they were quite potent. I'm quite excited.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_20 = With them, I'll be unstopable ! I'll be able to be the greatest archer ever !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_21 = No more will I be ridiculed by unarmed civilians ! No more !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_22 = I will hunt the greatest games. I'll become a legend !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_23 = I'm not going to allow this. Surrender while you can.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_24 = Surrender ? I am an archer, and you ? You have nothing !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_25 = Some ropes won't help you defeat someone like me !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_26 = The archer does a backflip, and disapears in a tree.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_27 = Where is he ? I can't see him anymore.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_28 = You think you can prevent my ascension to legend ? Dodge that !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_29 = Suddenly, I hear a arrow being shot from a tree not far from me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_30 = I barely have enough time to dodge it, but I manage it.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_31 = He fires again, from a different tree. Again, I barely dodge it. 
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_32 = I have to get out of here. I can't fight him like that.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_33 = I run away. He doesn't seem to be following me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_34 = Now, how should I deal with him ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_35 = I need a gun, but apparently they were all sold out.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_36 = .... Maybe the weird hunter can help me. If he can shoot...
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_37 = I should be able to find him at his house.

Swamp_ArcherQuest3_1 = Ah. There you are, lad.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_2 = I thought I saw the bloody archer here, but I was wrong.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_3 = There are only trees and rocks over here...
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_4 = I wonder where the bastard went. I have to teach him a lesson.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_5 = Follow me. I can guide you where I saw him last time.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_6 = But be ready. I almost died back then.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_7 = Don't worry about me. I'm right behind you, lad.    

Swamp_ArcherQuest4_1 = We manage to get back to the bridge.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_2 = But where is the archer ? It would be annoying if he went away.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_3 = Where is the bloody grouse killer ? WHERE ARE YOU ?!
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_4 = Don't yell. I'm here.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_5 = His voice comes from the trees. He's still hiding.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_6 = So you brought a friend ? Were you scared ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_7 = Show yourself ! Let us fight !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_8 = Ah ! I know my weaknesses. I won't make such a mistake.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_9 = If you want to fight, you'll have to do it like that !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_10 = Get down !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_11 = We hear an arrow being shot. I get down. It barely missed me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_12 = Why you little... You won't be able to climb trees when I'll be done with you !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_13 = Lad ! Help me spot him. I'll take the shot.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_14 = He thinks he's the best shot here... He doesn't know me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_15 = This is for the Ash Grouses !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_16 = We get ready to hunt the archer. 

Swamp_ArcherQuest4_17 = Argh !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_18 = The archer falls to the ground. We did it.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_19 = Well ! That was refreshing ! Nice job, lad.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_20 = You know what, I'll leave the rest to you.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_21 = All this firing made me hungry for grouses.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_22 = If you need me again. Come see me at my house.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_23 = Now then, if you'll excuse me...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_24 = The hunter leaves. Perfect.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_25 = Now I'll be able to deal with the archer however I want.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_26 = I approche him. He's trying to get up.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_27 = Y- You... You defeated me... again...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_28 = Why do I always get bested by unarmed civilians ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_29 = First that guy killed the dragon, now you... Why does this keep happening ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_30 = Why did you want to pillage the fortress ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_31 = I only wanted a little bit of fame. I only wanted to be liked...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_32 = Wherever I go, everybody keep their distance with me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_33 = So I thought that maybe, if I was famous, they would talk to me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_34 = I came here, and killed the swamp's ogre. But alas...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_35 = It seems fame wasn't the only thing I required in order to be liked...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_36 = Soon afterwards, Lord Ember was killed in his fortress.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_37 = I had heard that the fortress contained various artefacts. Some of wich are very potent.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_38 = So I set out to enter the now empty fortress to find artefacts. In hope that one could solve my problem.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_39 = ... I don't think an artefact can help you with that...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_40 = Whatever. Just promise you won't pillage it. Or there won't be another time.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_41 = O- Of course ! I promise !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_42 = Great. Now move. I don't have all night.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_43 = The archer crosses the bridge and exits the swamp.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_44 = Well... I did it.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_45 = I let him go, since he was so pathetic...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_46 = Well then. Time to deal with Rickey, the CEO of RickeyLand.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_47 = He should be in his amusement park. But who know for how long ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_48 = I could be too late. I have to hurry.

Swamtyr_Car_1 = A burned car. Someone beat me to it.

Swamtyr_OldMan_Default_1 = This archer is bad business...

Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherGone_1 = The archer is finally gone. That's a relief.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherGone_2 = Now I'll be able to forage mushrooms in peace.

Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_1 = Hey, you. Have you seen an archer around here ?
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_2 = Uh ? Oh, hello. Why, yes. I know an archer who lives here.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_3 = He lives in this house, right here.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_4 = The old man points to the left house. Perfect.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_5 = But if you want to meet him, you're out of luck.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_6 = He went to the swamp about an hour ago. He said something about "training before the expedition".
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_7 = Great... Now I'll have to search the swamp for him.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_8 = But why do want to meet him, if I may ?
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_9 = He's.... about to do a mistake. And I have to prevent that.   
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_10 = I see. This boy sure is troublesome. 
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_11 = Ever since he killed that ogre, he's bragging all day about it.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_12 = He even forbade me from entering the swamp without him. What a joke.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_13 = Interresting... I'll talk to him about that.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_14 = Well, time to search the swamp. I don't have much time.  

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------- Montagnes ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Mountains_Sign_Default_1 = "House of the great wizard of Vlatyr"
Mountains_Sign_Default_2 = Where is the house ?

Mountains_Car_1 = It seems no car can escape Lord Ember's wrath. I don't even know how it got here.

Mountains_KeysQuest0_1 = "House of the great wizard of Vlatyr" is written on the sign.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_2 = But, something is wrong. Where is the house ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_3 = GUARD told me the wizard lived somewhere here, but I can't find him...
Mountains_KeysQuest0_4 = I guess the sign is just misplaced ? Maybe he lives elsewhere.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_5 = Well... where are in a mountainous environment. He could be anywhere.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_6 = Hold on, hold on, hold on !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_7 = A man in purple robes appears out of nowhere and starts yelling at me.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_8 = Who are you ?! Are you the wizard ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_9 = You dare insult my sign, insolent ! I shall punish you for that !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_10 = I am the great wizard of Vlatyr, one of the greatest in the country !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_11 = And this, is my house ! The sign is right !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_12 = He points at the grass. There is no house there...
Mountains_KeysQuest0_13 = I'm sorry... I'm not sure I understand....
Mountains_KeysQuest0_14 = WHAT ?! Can you not see ? Can you not see my magnificent home ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_15 = I live here ! It's the greatest house ever !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_16 = Is he.... insane, perhaps ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_17 = Hey ! Are you listening ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_18 = Y- Yes ! I am !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_19 = So, apologize about my sign and my beautiful house.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_20 = Uhm... sorry ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_21 = Great ! Now we're friends !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_22 = Uh ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_23 = I... should just ask him about the keys.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_24 = Yeah... uhm... May I ask you something ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_25 = Of course ?! What do you want ? A magical fox ?!
Mountains_KeysQuest0_26 = N- No ! I wanted to ask you about the Ember fortress.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_27 = I heard the keys were stolen, and I need them in order to enter the fortress.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_28 = Do you perhaps know where the keys are ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_29 = THE KEYS ?! Don't disrespect Talia !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_30 = Talia ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_31 = I saved her from this monstrous guard at the fortress.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_32 = I love her, we just got married !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_33 = Uh ? Uh ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_34 = So... you married keys ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_35 = Don't you dare compare her to other keys !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_36 = Maybe she looks like one, but she's special !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_37 = There is a dragon engraved on her !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_38 = So it's just a normal key.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_39 = I get it ! You want to kidnap Talia ! You want to steal my wife !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_40 = I won't let you ! I'll kill you !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_41 = The wizard is starting to cast spells. I may be in trouble.

Mountains_KeysQuest0_42 = Impossible ! How did you evade my magic attacks ?
Mountains_KeysQuest0_43 = Quick ! I have to retreat for now ! To my house !
Mountains_KeysQuest0_44 = The wizard runs away.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_45 = While running, he drops the fortress's keys.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_46 = Well... I guess I have the keys now.
Mountains_KeysQuest0_47 = Time to head back to GUARD. He'll want to get his keys back.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# --------------- Forteresse ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Fortress_Arrival_1 = After walking for a bit, I finally arrive at the fortress.
Fortress_Arrival_2 = Spooky....
Fortress_Arrival_3 = So, the dragon lives here ? A fortress just for himself, uh ?
Fortress_Arrival_4 = Time to enter. I don't know how I will deal with him though...

Fortress_Gate_MainQuest5_1 = I don't have to go back there.

Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_1 = There is a man on the balcony. He seems to be watching the entrance.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_2 = Maybe he knows where the dragon is. I should try talking to him.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_3 = Excuse me, sir. I would like to enter this fortress.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_4 = Uh ? You want to enter the fortress ? Sure, why not...
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_5 = It was this easy to gain access ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_6 = ... Hold on a second ! I can't just let you get in without checking your intents !
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_7 = Or not... At least I tried.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_8 = Why are you seeking to enter the fortress ? Uh ? Uh ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_9 = Let me guess. You want to kill our benevolent lord Ember, and steal the treasure ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_10 = You want to steal it all for yourself, and become rich ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_11 = You want to stop our magnificent lord from burning cars ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_12 = You... wait, that actually sounded like a good thing to do...
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_13 = He... nevermind. Let's just pretend that I don't want to kill the dragon.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_14 = Oh, no. I don't want to kill our lord, I want to pay tribute to him.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_15 = I brought... gold and treasures. I hope that he will like it.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_16 = Oh... That's a nice tribute to our lord.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_17 = I'm sure he will appreciate all this... wait...
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_18 = You don't seem to be carrying much... Are you perhaps... lying ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_19 = Oh... no. I just don't have much gold to begin with.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_20 = I'm just a poor farmer, paying tribute for my crops.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_21 = Uh.... Lie or no lie ? That is the question....
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_22 = Dammit ! I'm not going to lose my job again because of a mistake like that.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_23 = Okay ! I know what to do ! I know how to be sure of your intentions.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_24 = Answer  me ! Are you going to kill lord ember ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_25 = Uh... no ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_26 = Uhm..... Uhm.... is it the truth ? 
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_27 = I don't know... I don't know... I don't want to lose my job.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_28 = I swear, I'm not going to kill him.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_29 = .... I see.... Alright... I trust you.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_30 = But ! I'm very sorry. I can't just let you walk in.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_31 = You see, lord Ember is currently very busy. So I can't let you disturb him.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_32 = If you really want to disturb him, you'll need a VIP pass.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_33 = A VIP pass, seriously ? There is such thing ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_34 = If you want to acquire one, you'll need to go to RickeyLand.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_35 = It's the amusement park that is next to the swamp. It should be open by now.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_36 = Due to a partnership, VIP passes are distributed everyday, at noon.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_37 = So head over there, get a pass, and come back here. I'll be waiting for your return.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest2_38 = Oh... and call me GUARD, will you ? It's my codename from back in the days.

Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Default = Do you require assistance, peasant ?

Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_1 = Head over to RickeyLand, and get a VIP pass.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_2 = You won't be able to enter until you get one.

Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_3 = You... you got the autograph ?!
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_4 = Damn it ! I had lost all hopes to ever get it.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_5 = It's not easy when your opponent has swords...
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_6 = Can I enter the fortress now ? I got your autograph.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_7 = .... Alright. This is embarrassing...
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_8 = I... lost the key to the fortress...
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_9 = And the door is locked. So I can't even exit.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_10 = Where did you lose it ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_11 = Well, you see. There is a self proclaimed wizard living around here.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_12 = He mostly stays in his house, but not today apparently.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_13 = He came, and stole the keys using his magic.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_14 = Don't ask me why. I don't know why anyone would do that.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_15 = ...Alright. I'll find the keys.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest3_16 = You'll do that ? Thanks !

Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest4_1 = You need to find the wizard who stole the fortress's keys.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_MainQuest4_2 = He lives in the mountains not far from here.

Fortress_Gate_GUARD_OtherJob_1 = I first started my career as a bodyguard for a politician.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_OtherJob_2 = I had to follow him everywhere in the capitol, Aajotyr.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_OtherJob_3 = But one day, I was fooled by a cleverly disguised assassin.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_OtherJob_4 = Long story short, the politician got killed, and I lost my job.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_OtherJob_5 = I searched for a new job for months. Nobody wanted a failed bodyguard.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_OtherJob_6 = But then, lord Ember hired me ! He saw potential in me.

Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Assassin_1 = You know, the assassination happened a few months back.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Assassin_2 = Nobody knows who the assassin is. He disappeared right after the incident.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Assassin_3 = But let me tell you, this is just too fishy !
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Assassin_4 = The politician in question was investigating a strange cult. Something about summoning ?
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Assassin_5 = He kept everything to himself. He never told me anything about his findings.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Assassin_6 = So, when he died, so did his findings on the cult.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Assassin_7 = I'll bet even my revolver that the cult had something to do with this.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Assassin_8 = I'll get to the bottom of this, I'm telling you !
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Assassin_9 = I... just need some money beforehand... I'm a little short right now.

Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Ember_1 = Lord Ember is the generous lord of this fortress.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Ember_2 = I was lucky to be selected as it's guard. This is an honor.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Ember_3 = Some say lord Ember is a monster, a tyrant. But let me tell you.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Ember_4 = Who gave me a chance when I had troubles ? Lord Ember.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Ember_5 = Who shunned me after failing to prevent an assassination ? Not him.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Ember_6 = Maybe he likes to burn cars, and houses, and crops, and peoples.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Ember_7 = But deep down, he's very nice. I'm sure of it.
Fortress_Gate_GUARD_Ember_8 = At least, I hope so... I have yet to get last month's salary.

Fortress_MainQuest5_1 = Ah, you found the keys ! Good job !
Fortress_MainQuest5_2 = Yes, I defeated the wizard who stole them.
Fortress_MainQuest5_3 = Good. At least that's one less source of worries in the region.
Fortress_MainQuest5_4 = He is known for doing illogical things all over the region.
Fortress_MainQuest5_5 = Things like stealing doors, or turning cars into rabbits.
Fortress_MainQuest5_6 = There doesn't seem to be a deep meaning to these acts. It's very annoying...
Fortress_MainQuest5_7 = I see... Well, he won't be troubling people for a while, I think.
Fortress_MainQuest5_8 = Right. But hey, you can enter the fortress now.
Fortress_MainQuest5_9 = Go pay your tribute to our lord. Just remember to give me back the keys after leaving.
Fortress_MainQuest5_10 = Of course.
Fortress_MainQuest5_11 = Finally. After all this time, I can finally enter the fortress.
Fortress_MainQuest5_12 = I open the gate using the keys. It's the end.
Fortress_MainQuest5_13 = Hold t !
Fortress_MainQuest5_14 = I hear a familiar voice. It's the samurai from before !
Fortress_MainQuest5_15 = I cameth to killeth the lacking valor dragon, Lord Ember !
Fortress_MainQuest5_16 = I believeth I toldeth thee I would beest the one to doth t.
Fortress_MainQuest5_17 = Hold on ! You can't enter without being authorized !
Fortress_MainQuest5_18 = A guard ? Bootless ! I'll killeth the dragon concluded, be it !
Fortress_MainQuest5_19 = Over my dead body, you fiend !
Fortress_MainQuest5_20 = Katsumoto shoves me to the side, and enters the fortress.
Fortress_MainQuest5_21 = GUARD follows suits using the balcony's door.
Fortress_MainQuest5_22 = I don't like where this is going.
Fortress_MainQuest5_23 = I mean, maybe it would be easier to let Katsumoto kill the dragon for me.
Fortress_MainQuest5_24 = But he might end up stealing whatever Harold told me to get.
Fortress_MainQuest5_25 = So, I have to catch up with him.   
Fortress_MainQuest5_26 = I enter the fortress, time to end this.
Fortress_MainQuest5_27 = After walking for a bit, I find GUARD cowering in a corner.
Fortress_MainQuest5_28 = GUARD ?! Are you hurt ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_29 = No... It's just... I'm lost...
Fortress_MainQuest5_30 = L- Lost ?! Don't you know the place ? You work here !
Fortress_MainQuest5_31 = Well... The fortress is a maze. So many doors, and only one of them can get you to Lord Ember.
Fortress_MainQuest5_32 = And I can't remember which one...
Fortress_MainQuest5_33 = This could be a problem. I might end up getting lost too if I'm not careful.
Fortress_MainQuest5_34 = I'll find Lord Ember, don't worry.
Fortress_MainQuest5_35 = Really ? Thanks...
Fortress_MainQuest5_36 = Well, time to go.
Fortress_MainQuest5_37 = I start walking, unsure where to go.

Fortress_MainQuest5_38 = I finally arrive at Lord Ember's room.
Fortress_MainQuest5_39 = It is gigantic, and full of gold.
Fortress_MainQuest5_40 = Strange... I feel like I've seen it before...
Fortress_MainQuest5_41 = No matter ! I should focus on findin-
Fortress_MainQuest5_42 = -Katsumoto... who is currently playing with a flute.
Fortress_MainQuest5_43 = The dragon is next to him. He seems to be in a daze.
Fortress_MainQuest5_44 = What is Katsumoto doing ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_45 = Heareth this quite quaint melody, most wondrous dragon.
Fortress_MainQuest5_46 = Alloweth this lullaby putteth thee to catch but a wink with ease.
Fortress_MainQuest5_47 = Catch but a wink with ease, as t shalt beest thy most wondrous nap ev'r.
Fortress_MainQuest5_48 = Is he charming the dragon with his flute ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_49 = It seems to be working at least.
Fortress_MainQuest5_50 = Uh ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_51 = Katsumoto played a wrong note. The dragon starts moving again.
Fortress_MainQuest5_52 = Grr ! How dare you try to charm me with your flute !
Fortress_MainQuest5_53 = I'll roast you alive !
Fortress_MainQuest5_54 = The dragon's fire breath embraces Katsumoto.
Fortress_MainQuest5_55 = The samurai falls to the ground, fuming from the fire.
Fortress_MainQuest5_56 = Lord Ember turns towards me. I'm in trouble.
Fortress_MainQuest5_57 = Grr ! This feeble human thought he could kill me with a cheap trick !
Fortress_MainQuest5_58 = What about you, mortal ? Are you too here to kill me ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_59 = I... I was sent by Harold, a local, to stop your crime spree !
Fortress_MainQuest5_60 = Harold ?! This idiot sent you ? If he wants his belongings so badly, he should come face me !
Fortress_MainQuest5_61 = His belongings ? I'm not sure I understand...
Fortress_MainQuest5_62 = He never told you, what he's really after ? Hilarious !
Fortress_MainQuest5_63 = I love to burn cars, it's a cool prank !
Fortress_MainQuest5_64 = But with Harold, I decided to do something different. I stole his car's keys !
Fortress_MainQuest5_65 = So now, the only way for him to use his car again is to come here and get them !
Fortress_MainQuest5_66 = But it would seem he ended up finding someone else to send in his stead. What a loser !
Fortress_MainQuest5_67 = Harold.... I'm really doing this for keys ?!
Fortress_MainQuest5_68 = I must say, I'm disappointed in him. I wanted my revenge for last time.
Fortress_MainQuest5_69 = But, I suppose you'll be a fine consolation prize.
Fortress_MainQuest5_70 = Time to die, mortal ! Any last words ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_71 = Uhm.... Let's not do this ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_72 = Grr ! No.
Fortress_MainQuest5_73 = I have to find something, quick ! Or I'll end up just like in my dream !
Fortress_MainQuest5_74 = I scan the room. There must be something, anything.
Fortress_MainQuest5_75 = My gaze stops on Katsumoto's flute.
Fortress_MainQuest5_76 = Maybe I can charm the dragon again, then kill him.
Fortress_MainQuest5_77 = I pick up the flute, and prepare myself.
Fortress_MainQuest5_78 = The flute ?! Didn't you see what happened with the other one ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_79 = It won't save you ! You'll only delay your inevitable death.
Fortress_MainQuest5_80 = I'll try anyway ! Please, listen to  my soft melody.
Fortress_MainQuest5_81 = I start playing the flute, hoping to be successful.

Fortress_MainQuest5_82 = I did it. I charmed the dragon !
Fortress_MainQuest5_83 = I just have to find a way to dispose of him...
Fortress_MainQuest5_84 = Oh ! I know !
Fortress_MainQuest5_85 = And now, Lord Ember. Please fly into a volcano.
Fortress_MainQuest5_86 = Mhm... Yes... Of course....
Fortress_MainQuest5_87 = The dragon flies off. Where, you may ask ? I don't know...
Fortress_MainQuest5_88 = But at least, he isn't here anymore. He should die in a volcano.
Fortress_MainQuest5_89 = Well, time to find Harold's "treasure"...
Fortress_MainQuest5_90 = I start searching. The place is full of gold, but I can't see keys...
Fortress_MainQuest5_91 = After a while, I finally find them, hidden behind a gold bar.
Fortress_MainQuest5_92 = Good. Time to head back. Harold will be waiting for me.
Fortress_MainQuest5_93 = Still, I can't believe he tricked me like that.
Fortress_MainQuest5_94 = I mean... I understand why he would be reticent to telling me the truth, but still...
Fortress_MainQuest5_95 = I head outside and pass the main gate.
Fortress_MainQuest5_96 = I can't find GUARD anywhere. I guess he ran off while I was fighting the dragon.
Fortress_MainQuest5_97 = Oh well, I guess I'll take the fortress keys as a souvenir.
Fortress_MainQuest5_98 = Time to head back to Harold.
