Intro_1 = The province of Vlatyr, peaceful constituant of the wider united provinces of Kosky.

Intro_4 = But... These peaceful days would soon be over.
Intro_5 = A tyrant, known as Lord Ember, came to this land.
Intro_6 = What was it seeking ? Revenge. Revenge for something that had been done to him.

Intro_8 = Before long, he took control of the old mountain fortress, now known as the 'Ember Fortress'.
Intro_9 = Nobody dared to approach the fortress, for the dragon was too strong for most people.
Intro_10 = People only speculated on his origins, who he was trying to get revenge on.
Intro_11 = But I knew the truth. I saw the beast with my own two eyes before.
Intro_12 = Lord Ember came from the West-most region of Runan, the snowy province.
Intro_13 = There, he remained. Sleeping, mostly. At the time, he was much weaker.
Intro_14 = At one point, he got into a fight with a human. He lost, and vowed revenge on him.
Intro_15 = He then obtained an ancient artefact, capable of making its user much stronger.
Intro_16 = Using his newfound powers, he tried to kill his old nemesis.
Intro_17 = However, he failed and the human managed to flee. Where ? To the East-most region of Vlatyr.
Intro_18 = Lord Ember wasn't, of course, going to stop there. So he followed suite.
Intro_19 = After rampaging in the province for a while. He decided to stop, and stay at the Ember Fortress.
Intro_20 = But a hero from another world came, and entered the fortress. His goal ? Kill Lord Ember. 
Intro_21 = He managed to do so, and brought back stability to the province.
Intro_22 = However, this newfound peace was soon to be disturbed again...
Intro_23 = The now empty fortress was full of gold and ancient artefacts.
Intro_24 = Greed pushed some individuals to seek to control the fortress.
Intro_25 = As they got ready to launch their respective expedition to the fortress, the province descended into uncertainty.
Intro_26 = Everyone knew that there would be one who would control the fortress. But who ? 
Intro_27 = And what would they do with their newfound money ? Live in luxury ? Try to take over the province ?
Intro_28 = Vlatyr needed a new hero. Someone who would come and defeat the troublemakers.
Intro_29 = And this is where you come in, hero !
Intro_30 = As you can see, we are all in danger. We need you help !
Intro_31 = The dragon died two weeks ago, but we are still in trouble.
Intro_32 = Two individuals expressed interest in taking over the fortress, out of greed.
Intro_33 = I waited a little bit, because I thought things would quiet down. I was wrong.

Intro_36 = I handpicked you, because you were the strongest candidate I knew.
Intro_37 = I specialize in summoning heros from other worlds, you see.
Intro_38 = So. You will help me, right ?

Intro_39 = Ah ! But we'll have to think of a codename for you.
Intro_40 = You don't want your ennemies to recognize your real name. Plus, it's really cool !

Intro_42 = Whatever. Just tell me what to do.
Intro_43 = Straight to the point, I like that.
Intro_44 = I'll explain everything to you. We have much to do, and not enough time.
Intro_45 = There are two individuals you have to defeat.
Intro_46 = The first is an archer from the Forestyr province.
Intro_47 = He first came here a few weeks ago to hunt in the local swamp.
Intro_48 = Now, he wants to steal the fortress's artefacts. Some are really dangerous.
Intro_49 = You should find him in Swamtyr, a small village next to the swamp.
Intro_50 = The second individual is Rickey, the CEO of RickeyLand, a local amusement park.
Intro_51 = Onced a revered CEO, it seems he went insane with greed.
Intro_52 = He wants to steal the fortress's gold, and make it his main residence.
Intro_53 = We can't let that happen. The gold doesn't belong to him.
Intro_54 = You'll probably find him at RickeyLand, altought the park is currently closed.
Intro_55 = Use any mean necessary to prevent them from attacking the fortress.
Intro_56 = I would recommand using non lethal force. But the choice is ultimatly yours.
Intro_57 = I can work with that.
Intro_58 = Great ! One last note. We are very short on time.
Intro_59 = They are getting ready as we speak, and may attack at any time.
Intro_60 = It is entierly possible that while you deal with one of them, the other could attack the fortress.
Intro_61 = If this happens, don't forget that your goal is to protect it.
Intro_62 = Got it. Anything else ?
Intro_63 = Ah, yes. First, I want you to go to Vlatyr.
Intro_64 = One of my acquaintance, Mr.Boyardee, has tools for you. You'll need them to fight our ennemies.
Intro_65 = So head over, and talk to him. That is all.
Intro_66 = Alright. I know everything I wanted.
Intro_67 = Oh, but do be mindful with him. He's... unique ?
Intro_68 = Don't worry. I won't bite him.
Intro_69 = Of course. I'll be here if you need me for anything.
Intro_70 = I turn around, and exit the house.
Intro_71 = The night is cold. At least it isn't raining.
Intro_72 = What a strange man, this Harold...
Intro_73 = I was minding my own business, when I suddenly passed out.
Intro_74 = When I came to, he was here. He talked about this fortress of his for hours.
Intro_75 = I couldn't care less. If anything, I would like to steal the gold for myself.
Intro_76 = But I guess he's the one that made me come here. I shouldn't anger him too much.
Intro_77 = Oh well, time to go to this 'Vlatyr' city. 
Intro_78 = I can interract with glowing objects, or general areas. I can also move by interracting with the screen's bottom corner.

ChezHarold_Harold_WhyMe_5 = I believed the other candidate would refuse to help me, since I summoned him before.
ChezHarold_Harold_WhyMe_6 = He was the one who killed the dragon, you see. I thought he deserved to rest a little.
ChezHarold_Harold_WhyMe_7 = Which only left you, [MC]. You honestly impressed me with your combat skills.

ChezHarold_Harold_You_9 = I picked mine, and learned all about summoning people from other worlds.
ChezHarold_Harold_You_10 = That way, if things were to ever go bad, I could use my powers to summon a hero from another world.

ChezHarold_Harold_Guild_1 = I founded the guild a few years ago. Back then, it was just me.
ChezHarold_Harold_Guild_2 = Since we are secretive vigilantes of some sort, we could just ask for members in the open.
ChezHarold_Harold_Guild_3 = Because of that, most of our members have links with each other. It's not a bad thing.
ChezHarold_Harold_Guild_4 = Our goal, like I told you before, is to face the various ordeal the world has to offer.

ChezHarold_Harold_Guild_6 = Whenever an ordeal appears, we are ready.

ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest1_1 = You can now proceed to deal with our targets.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest1_2 = Rickey is currently preparing in his park, RickeyLand.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest1_3 = Beware, I heard he hired security recently. He is also trigger happy.
ChezHarold_Harold_MainQuest1_4 = The archer should be in Swamtyr, a small village near the swamp.

ChezHarold_End_11 = You can't even begin to understand how much this was a problem.

# ------------------- Vlatyr ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_Done_1 = I don't need to go back in there.

Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_1 = I enter Boyardee's place. It's a wierd restaurant.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_2 = Harold told me he had equipments for me. I hope he was right.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_3 = Because I sure as hell won't be eating here. The odor is fool...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_4 = Maybe that's why there aren't anyone here. How did the owner stay in business ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_5 = Oh, hello there !
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_6 = A strange man approaches me. He's wearing a chef outfit, is he the owner ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_7 = Coming to eat alone ? No problems !
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_8 = What will it be ? We have many types of pastas and salads. Today's special is the chocolate cinnamon pasta.  
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_9 = What the hell ? No, I'm not eating that.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_10 = No, no. I'm here on behalf of Harold. He told me you had equipments for me.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_11 = Oh, right ! It's true.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_12 = Harold called me this morning and told me to get equipments for a mission.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_13 = I don't have much, a rope, a hook, stuff like that.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_14 = Enough to scale a wall at least.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_15 = Harold also told me to buy a gun, for safety. But I couldn't find one.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_16 = Apparently, a bunch of security guards from RickeyLand came in the morning. They bought everything.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_17 = This might be a problem. RickeyLand will be heavily guarded.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_18 = Well, thanks anyway. I'm sure I will need these tools for my mission.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_19 = Yes, Uhm... actually... Could I ask a favor ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_20 = Oh no....
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_21 = I'm expecting a lot of clients in a moment, and I'm a little short-handed.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_22 = You seem dependable. Would you mind helping me serve them ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_23 = Damnit ! I knew it would end up like that...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_24 = Look, it's not that I don't want to, but I really need to hurry.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_25 = Harold sent me on an urgent mission, every minutes count.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_26 = If I don't hurry, we could all be in trouble.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_27 = But my clients are an urgent matter too ! I need your help.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_28 = ... You leave me no choice ! I didn't want to do this...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_29 = I'm taking the equipments hostage !
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_30 = You won't get them until you help me with the clients.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_31 = Is he serious ? I don't have time for this.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_32 = But... I don't have a choice, do I ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_33 = I could take them by force, but Harold would be furious.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_34 = Alright, I'll help you.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_35 = Splendid ! I'm happy we came to an arrangement.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_36 = And just in time ! It seems our clients are arriving.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_37 = Go into the kitchen, I'll tell you what to do.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_38 = Okay, okay.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_39 = I move towards the kitchen's door, at the back of the restaurant.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_40 = I don't have time for this, but here we go.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_41 = I enter the kitchen, and prepares myself for cooking.

Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_42 = I'm done with cooking. Finally...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_43 = I exit the kitchen. Boyardee has to give me the equipments now.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_44 = Ah, there you are. 
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_45 = It seems my clients are very impressed with your cooking. Good job.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_46 = Now, I won't get into troubles again at the conference.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_47 = Uh ? What conference ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_48 = Well... The clients are relatives of mine. They came to say "hi" essentially.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_49 = However, last time they came, I failed my cooking. The chocolate was too hot.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_50 = At the next familial conference, I was ridiculed for this...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_51 = So thanks to me, this failed cook will not be ridiculed next time...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_52 = I'm impressed he managed to stay open for so long. The ingredients he uses are... original.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_53 = Can I have the equipments now ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_55 = Oh, right ! Here.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_56 = He finally hands me the equipments I was searching for.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_57 = I trust you'll be able to succeed in your mission, whatever it is.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_58 = Yeah, yeah.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_59 = I already wasted too much time here. I have to hurry.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_60 = I start exiting the restaurant.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_61 = While doing so, I gaze upon the clients that ordered the pizzas.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_62 = They are a strange bunch... They are wearing robes, are they religious people ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_63 = Whatever, I don't have time for this.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_64 = I exit the restaurant. Thankfully, it's still nightime.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_65 = Time to-
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_66 = Hey, lad.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_67 = Some sort of hunter approaches me. What now ?            
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_68 = I'm searching for an Ash Grouse, did you see one ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_69 = A what ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_70 = A bird ! A little chicken ! A chicken that actually fly !
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_71 = I'm hunting it right now. But I can't find one...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_72 = I don't think you'll be able to find such a bird in a city.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_73 = Hmm.... You think so ?
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_74 = I asked Ol' Harold. "There are many Grouses in Vlatyr", he told me.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_75 = Maybe he misunderstood me.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_76 = Or maybe you misunderstood him. Vlatyr is also a region...
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_77 = Shoot. I'll just go back home. Maybe I can spot one there.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_78 = If you find a Ash Grouse, or any type of bird, come see me.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_79 = I'll help you hunt it. I'm an expert sharpshooter.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_80 = The hunter walks away. What a strange encounter.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_81 = Time to attack our targets.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_82 = Rickey is hiding in RickeyLand, his amusement park.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_83 = The archer is currently staying in the small village of Swamtyr.
Vlatyr_ChezBoyardee_MainQuest0_84 = I have to be careful, I wasted too much time here. I may very well only be able to attack one of them.


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# -------------- Chez Marcel ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

ChezMarcel_Marcel_Default_1 = Hey, lad. Found any Ash Grouses ?

ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_1 = I'm just a local hunter. Nothing more.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_2 = I like to hunt grouses, and drink beers with my friends.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_3 = Do you know ol' Harold ? I drink with him sometimes.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutYou_4 = Although he doesn't hunt. He says he doesn't like guns. I wonder why...

ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutRickey_1 = Rickey ? What's that, a bird ?
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutRickey_2 = I'm sorry, I only take interest in wild animals. I'm a hunter, you see.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutRickey_3 = Ol' Harold might be able to help you with this nerd stuff.

ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_1 = Oh, him ? I hate his guts...
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_2 = 'Came here a few months ago, I'm already fed up.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_3 = He can't stop bragging about that ogre he killed.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_4 = Let me tell you, hunting Ogre is cheating. Grouses are superior.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_5 = And I don't see him hunting grouses, no.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_AboutArcher_6 = He spends his days in Swamtyr, bragging about his tale. What a loser...   

ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuestDone_1 = We showed this wanker what hunting really means.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuestDone_2 = Good ridance too... He was annoying.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuestDone_3 = Still. I can't believe he was going to kill all of Vlatyr's grouses.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuestDone_4 = I'm the only one authorised to do that !

ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_1 = Now to convince him to help me deal with the archer...
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_2 = Hey, lad. Have you found a Ash Grouse ?
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_3 = Oh, I know. He'll surely agree to help if I say that.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_4 = No, but I have bad news. It's about the archer.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_5 = Him ?! Don't tell me he killed yet another ogre...
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_6 = Please, I'll never hear the end of it.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_7 = No, no. I have troubling news however.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_8 = It seems he decided to kill all the grouses in the region.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_9 = What ?!
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_10 = If he succeeds, you can imagine how much he will brag.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_11 = Unacceptable ! It'll be the end of hunting in Vlatyr !
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_12 = I won't be able to hunt Ash Grouses anymore ! 
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_13 = I can't let this happen ! Where is this monster currently ?
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_14 = Perfect.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_15 = He's in the swamp, probably killing the wildlife as we speak.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_16 = I'll kill him ! He can't have my grouses !
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_17 = The hunter runs in the direction of the swamp. Perfect.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_18 = Now he'll help me deal with the archer.
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_19 = The sneaky bastard won't be able to hide from me now. 
ChezMarcel_Marcel_ArcherQuest2_20 = Time to head to the swamp. We don't want him to get lost.


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# ------------- Intersection ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------


Intersection_Intro_1 = I get to a crossroad. There are two paths in front of me.
Intersection_Intro_2 = The left path leads to some sort of amusement park. Maybe it's open ?
Intersection_Intro_3 = The right path leads to a dense forest.
Intersection_Intro_4 = I have to choose a path, but which one is the correct one ?


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# --------------- Rickeyland ------------------------------

RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_4 = The fortress and it's gold is mine !
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_5 = You there ! Get out of the way !
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_6 = The tank starts moving towards me.
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_7 = I move to the side, and watch it disapear in the distance.
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_8 = Damn it ! I was too late...
RickeyLandEntrance_RickeyGoesToFortress_9 = He must be headed to the fortress. I must catch up to him.


RickeyLandEntrance_Door_No_1 = I don't need to enter the park.

RickeyLandEntrance_Door_Enter_1 = Of course, the door is locked...
RickeyLandEntrance_Door_Enter_2 = ... I could use the gear Boyardee gave me to scale the wall though.
RickeyLandEntrance_Door_Enter_3 = However, once I'm in I won't be able to get out until I deal with Rickey.
RickeyLandEntrance_Door_Enter_4 = So, what should I do ?

RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_1 = I start scaling the park's wall.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_2 = It's hard, but I manage to do it.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_3 = Once in, I start walking aimlessly in the park.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_4 = Where could Rickey be ? I guess a place of importance ?
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_5 = I get to some sort of plaza. A statue of I assume Rickey is posing in the middle.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_6 = There is also a cage next to it. Someone's inside.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_7 = Oh ? Hey ! Over here !

RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_8 = Who are you ? What are you doing here ?
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_9 = As you can see, the park is currently closed until 9 AM.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_10 = Who I am doesn't matter. I must see the CEO of this place, Rickey.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_11 = Uh ? You want to see the CEO ?
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_12 = If I may, this isn't the time for a meeting. He's quite irritated now.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_13 = And you don't to meet him while he's like that, trust me.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_14 = You can see the result. He locked me up until dawn...
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_15 = I still can't believe he did that. All I did was...
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_16 = Where is he ?
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_17 = Uh ? I told you before, you shouldn't meet him right now.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_18 = Not while he's preparing for his expedition of his.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_19 = Listen. I need to stop him from launching his expedition. If he does, it'll be a disaster.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_20 = I know, I know, but...
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_21 = It's true that it's a really bad idea. Right from the start.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_22 = I mean... Taking over a fortress, and use it's money to pay back debts...
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_23 = This is insane. Banks won't allow this.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_24 = Is he in debts ?
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_25 = By Kalibu, you don't know ?
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_26 = RickeyLand, while relatively popular, is massively in debts.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_27 = The CEO keeps buying and buying. Useless things most of the time, too.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_28 = For example, yesterday, he bought 5 tanks using the park's money. We have no use for them.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_29 = We've been in the red for months now, and it keeps getting worse.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_30 = When I told him that, he just said "Just get more money from the bank".
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_31 = At first, we could just take some loans. We were only starting out.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_32 = But now, nobody wants to talk to us, and the banks want their money back.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_33 = I tried to tell the CEO that we had to change course, or else we would have to close shop.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_34 = But he just devised this insane plan to steal money from the fortress instead.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_35 = I told him it was madness, but he got angry and threw me here...
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_36 = I can stop him. Just tell me where he is.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_37 = I... Alright. But first, let me out of here.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_38 = No...
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_39 = I think one of the security guard might have the key to this cage.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_40 = Find them, and come back here.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_41 = When I'm out, I'll tell you where to find the CEO.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_42 = Alright, alright. I'll find those keys.
RickeyLand_RickeyQuest0_43 = I'm losing time with this, but I have no choice.

RickeyLand_Natasha_RickeyQuest1_1 = One of the guard must have the key to this cage.
RickeyLand_Natasha_RickeyQuest1_2 = Find it and let me out of here. I'll help you find the CEO.


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------- Marais ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Swamp_Intro_1 = Vlatyr's Swamp, uh...
Swamp_Intro_2 = So, the archer is somewhere here.
Swamp_Intro_3 = Time to find the man. I can't let him attack the fortress.

Swamp_ArcherQuest1_1 = After walking for a bit, I manage to find a bridge.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_2 = Someone is currently on it, watching the opposite side of the river.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_3 = Is he the archer ? Time to find out.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_4 = I approach him. He seems to notice me, and turns around.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_5 = Why, hello there.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_6 = I'm the great archer. I'm sure you heard of my heroic tales.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_7 = Killer of the swamp's ogre, great hunter, and more !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_8 = But let's not talk about that other guy and the dragon. I'm the important one, okay ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_9 = But what brings you here ? Oh, I know !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_10 = You need protection ? Are you too afraid to walk in the streets ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_11 = I can help with that ! I can protect you from any danger.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_12 = Hum, no. I don't recquire your services.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_13 = Such a fierce stare... You are different.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_14 = You... are a rival. Are you not ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_15 = Why did you come here ? Do you want to challenge me, the great archer ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_16 = You are planing to attack the Braise Fortress. I can't let you do that.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_17 = Attack ? What a joke ! I'm only going to visit it for a bit.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_18 = You know, I'll walk in its empty corridors, filling my pockets with precious artefacts.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_19 = I was told they were quite potent. I'm quite excited.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_20 = With them, I'll be unstopable ! I'll be able to be the greatest archer ever !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_21 = No more will I be ridiculed by unarmed civilians ! No more !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_22 = I will hunt the greatest games. I'll become a legend !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_23 = I'm not going to allow this. Surrender while you can.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_24 = Surrender ? I am an archer, and you ? You have nothing !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_25 = Some ropes won't help you defeat someone like me !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_26 = The archer does a backflip, and disapears in a tree.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_27 = Where is he ? I can't see him anymore.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_28 = You think you can prevent my ascension to legend ? Dodge that !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_29 = Suddenly, I hear a arrow being shot from a tree not far from me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_30 = I barely have enough time to dodge it, but I manage it.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_31 = He fires again, from a different tree. Again, I barely dodge it. 
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_32 = I have to get out of here. I can't fight him like that.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_33 = I run away. He doesn't seem to be following me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_34 = Now, how should I deal with him ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_35 = I need a gun, but apparently they were all sold out.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_36 = .... Maybe the weird hunter can help me. If he can shoot...
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_37 = I should be able to find him at his house.

Swamp_ArcherQuest3_1 = Ah. There you are, lad.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_2 = I thought I saw the bloody archer here, but I was wrong.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_3 = There are only trees and rocks over here...
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_4 = I wonder where the bastard went. I have to teach him a lesson.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_5 = Follow me. I can guide you where I saw him last time.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_6 = But be ready. I almost died back then.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_7 = Don't worry about me. I'm right behind you, lad.    

Swamp_ArcherQuest4_1 = We manage to get back to the bridge.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_2 = But where is the archer ? It would be annoying if he went away.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_3 = Where is the bloody grouse killer ? WHERE ARE YOU ?!
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_4 = Don't yell. I'm here.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_5 = His voice comes from the trees. He's still hiding.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_6 = So you brought a friend ? Were you scared ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_7 = Show yourself ! Let us fight !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_8 = Ah ! I know my weaknesses. I won't make such a mistake.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_9 = If you want to fight, you'll have to do it like that !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_10 = Get down !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_11 = We hear an arrow being shot. I get down. It barely missed me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_12 = Why you little... You won't be able to climb trees when I'll be done with you !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_13 = Lad ! Help me spot him. I'll take the shot.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_14 = He thinks he's the best shot here... He doesn't know me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_15 = This is for the Ash Grouses !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_16 = We get ready to hunt the archer. 

Swamp_ArcherQuest4_17 = Argh !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_18 = The archer falls to the ground. We did it.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_19 = Well ! That was refreshing ! Nice job, lad.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_20 = You know what, I'll leave the rest to you.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_21 = All this firing made me hungry for grouses.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_22 = If you need me again. Come see me at my house.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_23 = Now then, if you'll excuse me...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_24 = The hunter leaves. Perfect.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_25 = Now I'll be able to deal with the archer however I want.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_26 = I approche him. He's trying to get up.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_27 = Y- You... You defeated me... again...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_28 = Why do I always get bested by unarmed civilians ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_29 = First that guy killed the dragon, now you... Why does this keep happening ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_30 = Why did you want to pillage the fortress ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_31 = I only wanted a little bit of fame. I only wanted to be liked...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_32 = Wherever I go, everybody keep their distance with me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_33 = So I thought that maybe, if I was famous, they would talk to me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_34 = I came here, and killed the swamp's ogre. But alas...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_35 = It seems fame wasn't the only thing I required in order to be liked...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_36 = Soon afterwards, Lord Ember was killed in his fortress.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_37 = I had heard that the fortress contained various artefacts. Some of wich are very potent.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_38 = So I set out to enter the now empty fortress to find artefacts. In hope that one could solve my problem.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_39 = ... I don't think an artefact can help you with that...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_40 = Whatever. Just promise you won't pillage it. Or there won't be another time.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_41 = O- Of course ! I promise !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_42 = Great. Now move. I don't have all night.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_43 = The archer crosses the bridge and exits the swamp.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_44 = Well... I did it.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_45 = I let him go, since he was so pathetic...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_46 = Well then. Time to deal with Rickey, the CEO of RickeyLand.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_47 = He should be in his amusement park. But who know for how long ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_48 = I could be too late. I have to hurry. 

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------ Swamtyr ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Swamtyr_Car_1 = A burned car. Someone beat me to it.

Swamtyr_OldMan_Default_1 = This archer is bad business...

Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherGone_1 = The archer is finally gone. That's a relief.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherGone_2 = Now I'll be able to forage mushrooms in peace.

Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_1 = Hey, you. Have you seen an archer around here ?
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_2 = Uh ? Oh, hello. Why, yes. I know an archer who lives here.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_3 = He lives in this house, right here.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_4 = The old man points to the left house. Perfect.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_5 = But if you want to meet him, you're out of luck.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_6 = He went to the swamp about an hour ago. He said something about "training before the expedition".
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_7 = Great... Now I'll have to search the swamp for him.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_8 = But why do want to meet him, if I may ?
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_9 = He's.... about to do a mistake. And I have to prevent that.   
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_10 = I see. This boy sure is troublesome. 
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_11 = Ever since he killed that ogre, he's bragging all day about it.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_12 = He even forbade me from entering the swamp without him. What a joke.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_13 = Interresting... I'll talk to him about that.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_14 = Well, time to search the swamp. I don't have much time.  

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------- Montagnes ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Mountains_Sign_Default_1 = "House of the great wizard of Vlatyr"
Mountains_Sign_Default_2 = Where is the house ?

Mountains_Car_1 = It seems no car can escape Lord Ember's wrath. I don't even know how it got here.


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# --------------- Forteresse ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_1 = I finally arrive to the fortress.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_2 = But it seems I'm too late... Rickey is already here.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_3 = Ah Ah ! The fortress is mine !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_4 = Hold on ! 
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_5 = Uh ? Who are you ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_6 = Can't you see I'm busy reclaiming this abandoned fortress ? 
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_7 = It doesn't belong to you ! You can't do that.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_8 = What ?! I do as I please ! I'm a CEO !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_9 = What gives you the right to question my authority ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_10 = What is your name, vile monster ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_11 = Hum... Harold.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_12 = I'm not going to give him my real name, that's for sure.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_13 = Harold ! What a stupid name ! I hate it ! I hate you !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_14 = You can't get in my way ! I need to proceed !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_15 = But why ? Are you in debt or something ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_16 = You wouldn't understand ! The economy doesn't too !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_17 = I had it all ! Money, fame.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_18 = But it all disapeared ! It's Natasha's fault, I'm sure !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_19 = "We don't have money anymore. Nobody's even coming to the park." she told me. Lies !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_20 = I can't fail ! It's impossible ! Not after the previous attempts !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_21 = So this failure is a lie ! There is a deeper meaning to it.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_22 = People don't come to my park, they say. You hire too many bodyguards they say. Enough !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_23 = I need these bodyguards ! I need the tanks ! It's security ! Who doesn't like security ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_24 = And if people don't come to my park, it must be a conspiracy !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_25 = They want me to fail ! They're jaleous !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_26 = They're working with the governement, the police, the mountains, EVERYONE !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_27 = All so they can force me to close down my great RickeyLand !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_28 = But I won't let them, no !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_29 = They think they can get me with this "money" thing. They are wrong.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_30 = I'm going to take control of the fortress and it's gold.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_31 = I will use the gold to pay whatever "debts" they think I have.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_32 = And I will make this fortress my new HQ. The Grand Rickey Fortress !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_33 = It will strike fear into the conspirators, fear !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_34 = They will stop their plot against me. They will all return to my park !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_35 = They will bend their knees in front of me ! I will be a king, no, an emperor !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_36 = What a load of bullshit ! What are you even talking about ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_37 = Rha ! I knew you wouldn't understand ! You're just a peasant, Harold !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_38 = I hate you ! You must be conspiring with them !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_39 = The conspiracy already knew about my plans ! They sent you to dispose of me !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_40 = But I won't let you ! I'll dispose of you with my tank !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_41 = Prepare for battle, Harold !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_42 = Rickey prepares himself. And I have no weapons...

Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_43 = What are you doing, Harold ? Spacing out before a battle ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_44 = Hey... Is that an axe ? When did you get that ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_45 = Whatever ! It's time for you to die !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_46 = I prepare for battle.

Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_47 = Impossible ! How could you defeat me ?!
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_48 = No matter ! I'll just take control of the fortress anyway !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_49 = Rickey starts crossing the bridge in reverse.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_50 = Or at least, he tries to. Due to the size of his tank, he ends up driving off the cliff.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_51 = Uh ? Oh no !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_52 = SOMEONE HELP ! CEO IN DANGER !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_53 = The tank falls of the cliff. We won't be seeing Rickey anytime soon.

Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_1 = [MC] ! Can you hear me ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_2 = Suddenly, I hear Harold's voice.
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_3 = Uh ?!
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_4 = I'm using magic to contact you. I have something for you.
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_5 = I don't know how are things on your hand, but I found a weapon for you to use.
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_6 = Here !
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_7 = The vision gives me an axe. Now I can fight back.
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_8 = I'm hurrying to the fortress as I speak. Hang tight, [MC] !
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_9 = Harold disapears.

Fortress_MainQuest3_1 = [MC] ! There you are !
Fortress_MainQuest3_2 = Harold runs up to me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_3 = Where is our ennemy ? Did you already defeat him ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_4 = Yes. He was no match for me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_5 = Thanks for the axe, I guess. It helped a little.
Fortress_MainQuest3_6 = Eh Eh ! Don't be shy. But you're welcome, [MC] !
Fortress_MainQuest3_7 = Thanks to your efforts, peace has been restored to the province.
Fortress_MainQuest3_8 = The CEO and the archer have been defeated. Their plans were thwarted.
Fortress_MainQuest3_9 = I'll be able to sleep easily this night, I believe.
Fortress_MainQuest3_10 = You barely did anything...
Fortress_MainQuest3_11 = Who knows what tragedy would have happened had they taken control of the fortress...
Fortress_MainQuest3_12 = I'm glad you were able to intervene. Really, I am. Thank you so much.
Fortress_MainQuest3_13 = Nobody might know who you are, or what you did tonight. But I do.
Fortress_MainQuest3_14 = Actually... I have a favor to ask.
Fortress_MainQuest3_15 = You see, this isn't the first ordeal the province had to face.
Fortress_MainQuest3_16 = Before that, we had lord Ember. And before him, we had other dangers to face.
Fortress_MainQuest3_17 = When I was younger, I actually fought. Like you, I faced the various ordeals thrown in front of me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_18 = Alas... I got old. I couldn't fight anymore. So I turned to new venues. New ways to face the ordeals.
Fortress_MainQuest3_19 = I learned magic, and I founded a guild of some sort. We are vigilantes in a way.
Fortress_MainQuest3_20 = When an ordeal appears, we fight. Nobody knows who we are. We fight in the shadows, like I used to.
Fortress_MainQuest3_21 = If the ordeal is too much for us, that's when I come in.
Fortress_MainQuest3_22 = I hand pick a hero from another world, and summon him to help us.
Fortress_MainQuest3_23 = With their strength, we never lost even once.
Fortress_MainQuest3_24 = And now, you are that hero, [MC]. I summoned you to help us.
Fortress_MainQuest3_25 = Mr. Boyardee is actually a member of the guild. That why I asked you to meet him.
Fortress_MainQuest3_26 = We provided you assistance, because we knew you could do it.
Fortress_MainQuest3_27 = And now, I've been thinking...
Fortress_MainQuest3_28 = Usually, the heroes want to go back to their own world.
Fortress_MainQuest3_29 = But... I'm sorry, I read a little about your life during my search.
Fortress_MainQuest3_30 = You have nowhere to go, do you ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_31 = ...
Fortress_MainQuest3_32 = What about joining our guild ? It'll be your new home.
Fortress_MainQuest3_33 = We fight the various ordeals the world has to offer.
Fortress_MainQuest3_34 = But at heart, we are a all brothers and sisters. We're a familly.
Fortress_MainQuest3_35 = I could even help you find a place to settle in.
Fortress_MainQuest3_36 = So... What do you say ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_37 = Do you want to join us ?

Fortress_MainQuest3_Accept_1 = Alright... I'll join your guild.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Accept_2 = I see. Thank you for trusting me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Accept_3 = Well... Let's go back home for now.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Accept_4 = I'll introduce you to the guild in the afternoon.

Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_1 = No.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_2 = Even if I don't have anywhere to go back in my world. I can't join you.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_3 = There is too much I don't know about this world. Too much I'll miss from mine.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_4 = I see. Well, it's your choice.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_5 = Come, let's get back home.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_6 = I'll send you back to your world when we get back.

Fortress_MainQuest3_38 = Suddenly, a flash of light blinds me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_39 = When my vision comes back a moment later, I'm speechless.
Fortress_MainQuest3_40 = The fortress is now protected by a magic barrier.
Fortress_MainQuest3_41 = By Lord Elk ! What is this sorcery ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_42 = We defeated Rickey and the archer. What now ? Another contestant ?!
Fortress_MainQuest3_43 = I take it you didn't create the barrier ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_44 = No ! I can't even do that.
Fortress_MainQuest3_45 = Someone else placed it. But for what purpose ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_46 = I did it ! I did it !
Fortress_MainQuest3_47 = No...
Fortress_MainQuest3_48 = A small man appears in front of us, hovering in the air.
Fortress_MainQuest3_49 = You're that wizard that lives in the mountains, right ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_50 = But why ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_51 = I am connected to this fortress. I am married to her !
Fortress_MainQuest3_52 = What ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_53 = Sometime ago, I married Talia. She was the keeper of this place.
Fortress_MainQuest3_54 = But a meanie came and stole her from me !
Fortress_MainQuest3_55 = He even left this world with her ! He stole my wife !
Fortress_MainQuest3_56 = Wait... So that's why I could never find it !
Fortress_MainQuest3_57 = I bet they are currently having a honeymoon together. Talia !
Fortress_MainQuest3_58 = How could she ?! I thought she loved me !
Fortress_MainQuest3_59 = I was so sad ! I was so alone !
Fortress_MainQuest3_60 = My mansion felt so big, yet so small... Sadness !
Fortress_MainQuest3_61 = But then it hit me !
Fortress_MainQuest3_62 = Talia is the keeper of the forteress, and we still haven't filled for divorce.
Fortress_MainQuest3_63 = So technically, the fortress is mine !
Fortress_MainQuest3_64 = It's power is mine ! The orb is mine !
Fortress_MainQuest3_65 = No one can have it ! No one !
Fortress_MainQuest3_66 = So that's why you want the fortress. You want the chaos orb !
Fortress_MainQuest3_67 = I own it ! It's mine ! It will make me strong enough to bring Talia back !
Fortress_MainQuest3_68 = The wizard disapears. I didn't understand a thing.
Fortress_MainQuest3_69 = [MC] ! We are in trouble ! We can't let him use the orb !
Fortress_MainQuest3_70 = Wait, wait, wait. I don't understand. Who's Talia ? What's this orb ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_71 = I... right. You don't know.
Fortress_MainQuest3_72 = Well. Let's start with the orb.
Fortress_MainQuest3_73 = The chaos orb is a powerful artefact hidden in the fortress.
